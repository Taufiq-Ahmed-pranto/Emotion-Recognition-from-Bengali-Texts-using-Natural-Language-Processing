# Emotion Detection in Bengali Texts

## Abstract

This repository focuses on the coding aspects of emotion detection in Bengali texts. The project uses machine learning and deep learning techniques on a publicly available Bangla emotion dataset. The primary goals include developing a robust emotion detection model, enhancing performance metrics, evaluating the model on unseen data, and exploring various techniques for emotion classification.

## Coding Objectives

1. **Model Development:**
   - Implement machine learning and deep learning models for emotion detection in Bengali texts.
   - Utilize common libraries and frameworks for efficient coding.

2. **Performance Enhancement:**
   - Apply different feature engineering and embedding techniques to improve model performance.
   - Optimize code for faster execution and better resource utilization.

3. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Implement code to assess the model's effectiveness in classifying emotions from unseen data.
   - Incorporate evaluation metrics for quantifying model performance.

4. **Technique Investigation:**
   - Code implementations to explore the performance of various machine learning and deep learning techniques on the Bangla text-based corpus.
   - Ensure code modularity and scalability for easy experimentation with different techniques.


## Future Improvements

Possible enhancements and future work include:

- Integration of additional data augmentation techniques.
- Experimentation with state-of-the-art pre-trained language models.
